# [Google Minus](https://declanmorrison.github.io/Band-Info-Aggregator/)
###### In case you were wondering, it's called Google Minus, becuase it's exactly like Google, except it sucks.

## About this project:

This project utilizes several API's in order to pull together information on the chosen band. Current features include:
1. A list of Top 5 most searched artists.
1. Short Biography, with ability to read more.
1. A picture of the band/artist or most popular album, depending on availability.
1. A list of 5 albums (or less depending on availability) ranked by popularity.
1. An accordion menu that will display songs under the selected album. Songs are listed in order of appearance on album.
1. A pop-up that displays the most relevant YouTube video and song lyrics (depending on availability) when a song is clicked.
1. Smooth-as-butter animations.
1. A tastefully animated background.

## How to use:
Upon opening the application, you will be greeted by a tastefully minimalist popular search engine-esque user interface. Simply type in the name of the band or artist you would like to learn more about, and click the search button, or press enter! (It's like magic).

All the gathered information will fly into view. To search another band or artist, simply type their name into the search bar, which has conveniently moved itself to the top of the page, and search!
